 In the fast paced world human beings require everything to be automated. Our lifestyle demands everything to be remote controlled. Apart from a few things man has made his life automated. During summers, most people are too lazy to water the potted plants on their rooftop gardens every day. In the world of advanced electronics life of human beings should be simpler hence to make life simpler and convenient, so we introduce “Automatic Plant Watering System”. A model of controlling watering facilities to help millions of people.  In particular, soil moisture sensors can reduce the number of unnecessary irrigation events. This model uses sensor technology with a microcontroller to make a smart switching device. The model shows the basic switching mechanism of water pump using sensors that senses the moisture present in the soil by soil moisture sensor and finally an Email will be sent to the user that The plants are watered.
